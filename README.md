# E-Learning-App-MAD

E-Learning mobile Application || SLIIT Year 2 Semester 2 || Mobile Application Development

We have implemented an educational mobile application called "QUICK LEARN". Due to this covid-19 pandemic period all of us are locked up. Schools are closed. Students could not attend any extra classes. Most of the student’s education collapsed during this period. “Quick Learn” is an e-learning app focused on the A/L science stream students in Sri Lanka and the teachers, instructors who conduct online classes in science stream.
There are students who have chosen science stream and who are willing to choose science for their A/Ls. Due to this pandemic, they are unable to meet their teachers, senior students to get an idea about the syllabus and about the subject content. So here it gives the chance to get knowledge about the subject content.
Students feel bored while studying in the same pattern. For a change Quick Learn app brings a mini quiz time to students to get rid of bored and stressful life. Quick Learn app allows an extra ordinary opportunity to the community who are willing to conduct online classes. They can add an advertisement in the app. They can also manage the functions such as edit and delete.
There are five main functionalities we identified in this system

• User profile management function
• Subject management function
• Book store management function
• Mini quiz handling function
• Advertisement handling function

Tools and Technologies :
Java / Android Studio / Firebase
